			<p> SAKADAB is a community of persons with physical disabilities that live together in one community to help one another.
"Samahan ng may iba't ibang Kakayahan sa Dabaw" is their complete name. The SAKADAB organization works to improve the quality of life for
those who are physically disabled and to support their journey to independence. The physically disabled members of the organization
have benefited from SAKADAB's assistance in learning skills including baking, handicrafts, woodworking, and welding.<br><br>
				
				The residents of SAKADAB reside in homes resembling that of dormitories. Electricity and water bills
are split among the residents. But if there is a family, they live in a bigger house designed for children.
There are 35 people that reside in this community in total. 19 of them have ages that range from 20 to 50.
The remaining five are seniors. The remainder consists of accompanying adults and kids. They receive
financial assistance from their relatives as well.

The initial 27 physically challenged individuals who put out the proposal in 2010 are now in charge of the SAKADAB-GK village.
The original 27 people got to meet at the Our Lady of Victory - Training Center to talk about their shared goal for a neighborhood
where they could help and support one another. Mayor Inday Sarah Duterte of the City Government, Mr. Oscar Hidalgo, Gawad Kalinga,
and the Lions Club International were other participants in the project's conception and approval. The project also involves
Davao Light Corporation.<br><br>

The SAKADAB foundation/advocacy aims to help physically challenged people support each other in their daily lives.
despite these dissabilities, they are able to work together as one to provide steady income, food, and basic needs
towards them. The SAKADAB advocacy envisions a future of sustainability and stability in the lives of the people
who live there. They hope that one day, the SAKADAB advocacy can spread and expand towards other parts of Davao
and make a profound impact on peoples lives.
